# Lattice field theory - score-based generative diffusion models
Jupyter Notebooks with the code used to generate the results of the master's thesis 'Sampling lattice field theories with
score-based diffusion models' by Thomas Ranner.

To run properly, they require a CUDA supported GPU with memory > 10GB.
